Puzzle: You have two binary inputs x1 and x2 ∈{0,1}. You want a “majority” output: 1 if at least one input is 1, 0 if both are 0. Can you write a simple function that achieves this with addition and comparison?
Perceptron - a model for deep learning. 
Structure: Inputs → weights → sum → bias → activation → output.
Equation: y=activation(w1x1+w2x2+b)
Machine Learning: Adjust weights/bias to minimise errors on data.
